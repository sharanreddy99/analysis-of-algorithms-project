# Given a matrix p of m ×n integers (non-negative) representing the minimum number of trees that must be planted on each plot and an integer h (positive), find the bounding indices of a square area where all but the corner plots enclosed requires a minimum of h trees to be planted. The corner plots can have any number of trees required
